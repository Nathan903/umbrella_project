# not umbrella project

Welcome! This is the offical repo and site for the **`SHSID Umbrella Project`** aka **`SUP`**. All of our codes are released opensource under the GNU GPLv3 license.  

## To do
1. think of a cool name
2. contact factories to produce model (mechanics) 
3. start mass production ? (mechanics) 
4. improve the RFID sensors stability (arduino)
5. implement and wiring the Arduino with the Umbrella box (arduino)
6. connect to data base (web)
7. display users (web)
8. improve UI (web)
9. QR code btw server & wx app (server)


## Work distribution
User interface, server, and electric hardware are connected. Members in each group is responsible to cooperate with their adjacent groups to work on compatibility and connection

User Interface | Server | Electronic hardware | Mechanical hardware | Database | Art n design
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Oreo | Nathan | Charlie | Andy | Peter

(replace [name] with your name, and make a new row with |||)

finish prototype before winter break ends
## User Interface
wx mini app

## Server 

Use paid server. decided on 10.24.2019 meeting
- Host: undecided, see **`To Do`** `3.`.
- Linux
- Automation: bash auto command and python
- Connection: the server will be a file server host. The server and clients and update and read files in the server.
#### Python coding
- use 4-space tabs

`database`: if time and slave-power permit, we can have a SQL database. Else, we can just append data into a python file.

#### sending data
1. use arduino wifi board
2. send jason file to IP
3. python natives

##### settled: python socket between servers
